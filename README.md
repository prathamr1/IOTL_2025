# Arduino & ESP32 Code Repository

Welcome to the Arduino & ESP32 code repository! This collection contains various scripts and examples to help you with microcontroller-based projects.
This repository holds the codes of practicals that I've executed and implemented as a part of SPPU AI&DS Sem-IV IoT Laboratory course. 

## üìå Overview

This repository includes:
- [Arduino](Overview.md) sketches for various sensors and actuators
- ESP32 scripts for IoT and wireless applications
- Projects featuring **DHT11 temperature & humidity sensor**, **piezoelectric sensors**, and **analog potentiometer-based LED control**

## ‚ö° Getting Started

To use these codes:
1. Install the latest Arduino IDE: [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
2. Install required board definitions:
   - For ESP32: Follow the installation guide [here](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/installing.html)
3. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/prathamr1/IOTL_2025.git
Open .ino files in the Arduino IDE or .cpp scripts in a compatible editor.

4. [Basic Syntax and Funtions for Arduino CPP](Syntax_Funtions.md)

## üõ†Ô∏è Dependencies

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

DHT Sensor Library for temperature and humidity readings

ESP32 WiFi for wireless communication

Additional dependencies listed in each script's comments.


## üìñ Usage
DHT11 Sensor: Used for measuring temperature and humidity, ideal for environment monitoring projects.

Piezoelectric Sensor: Detects pressure changes, often used for impact detection and vibration sensing.

Analog Potentiometers & LED Control: Allows smooth adjustment of LED brightness using a rotary potentiometer.
