# Overview

_The Arduino Uno is a popular microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P. It's widely used in electronics and IoT projects due to its simplicity, versatility, and open-source nature. The Uno features a USB connection, power jack, and a set of digital and analog pins for interfacing with sensors, actuators, and other hardware._

## Pin Configuration
Power Pins: VIN, 3.3V, 5V, and GND

Digital I/O Pins: 14 pins (D0–D13), with some supporting PWM output

Analog Input Pins: 6 pins (A0–A5), used for reading analog sensors

Communication Pins:

TX/RX (Serial communication)

SDA/SCL (I2C communication)

SPI (MISO, MOSI, SCK, SS)

## Common Uses
Robotics and automation

IoT applications and smart devices

Sensor-based projects

Embedded systems prototyping

DIY electronics


## Pros: 
✅ Easy to program and beginner-friendly 
✅ Large community support and open-source ecosystem 
✅ Wide range of compatible modules and shields 
✅ Cost-effective and readily available

## Cons:
❌ Limited memory and processing power compared to advanced microcontrollers 
❌ No built-in Wi-Fi or Bluetooth (requires external modules) 
❌ Lower number of available I/O pins than some other boards
